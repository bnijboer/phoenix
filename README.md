## "The Goddess In Me" (Working title: "Phoenix") [WIP]

### Description

This is a blog I am currently creating for my mother.
I aim to make this a Inertia-powered SPA. The reason for this is because I want to get more experience using Vue, and I found Inertia.js to be a promising link between Laravel and Vue.
**Note**: this project is far from complete, but I decided to set it to public to showcase my current skills in Laravel and Vue.
